# Notes:
# Future ideas:
#   * locations vs planets.  Some planets may have multiple locations.
#   * Some commodities and equipment should only be sold in the Sol system
#     * May be bought elsewhere by looking at the commodity type
#   * Warehouse space could have a rental fee or upkeep fee.(and security fee)
