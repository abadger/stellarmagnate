Welcome to Stellar Magnate
==========================

In the late 1980s I played a game called |Planetary Travel| by `Brian Winn
<http://gel.msu.edu/winn/index.html>`_.  The game was a textual trading game where you had to take
a small amount of money and a space ship and travel between the planets of our solar system to make
money.

Stellar Magnate is a game written in that same genre but updated and enhanced.
Unlike the original Integer Basic that Planetary Travel was written in, this
is written in Python and makes use of asynchronous programming, abstractions
to allow multiple user interfaces, and other modern programming practices.

Stellar Magnate was written both to enjoy a little bit of nostalgia and to
have a practical problem on which to experiment with new technologies.  I hope
that the game is somewhat enjoyable and the core is simple enough that new
aspiring programmers can take a look at how it works to make it their own.
